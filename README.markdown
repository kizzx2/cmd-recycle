# What is this?

Working with the Windows command line doesn't have to be risky! Delete multiple files to the Recycle Bin:

    recycle file1 file2 supports-wildcards\*.tmp

# Usage

[Download the main executable](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/kizzx2/cmd-recycle/recycle.exe); put it in %PATH%; 'nuff said...

# Changelog

v0.2 - Proper exit codes when encountering error. If multiple files are given, the exit code for the last argument will be returned.

- 0: Success
- 1: Miscellaneous errors (such as permission)
- 2: File/pattern not found

# How does it work?

Visual Basic's [`FileSystem`][vb_filesystem] object has the `DeleteFile()` and `DeleteDirectory()` methods which both support an argument to specify deleting to the Recycle Bin. Luckily using .NET, we rolled this with C# alright.

## Some more story...

Support for programmatically deleting files to the Recycle Bin is surprisingly rare. [`SHFileOperation`][shfileoperation] used to be the only way to do it, but that Win32 API call is quite old and Microsoft [said the interface has been replaced by `IFileOperation`][replaced_with_ifileoperation]. Furthermore, I found my [homegrown program](http://kizzx2.com/blog/index.php/2008/09/27/windows-delete-to-recycle-bin-from-the-command-line/) (using `SHFileOperation`) stopped working after I migrated to Windows 7 x64.

The Windows API is such a pile of stuffs. I don't know if I'm using the new endorsed `IFileOperation` or whatnot, but this one here using Visual Basic's `FileSystem` seems to work alright, so I'll just leave it at that :)
